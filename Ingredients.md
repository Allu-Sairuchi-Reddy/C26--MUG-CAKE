The ingredients we need are:-
¼ cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
⅛ teaspoon baking soda
⅛ teaspoon salt
3 tablespoons milk
2 tablespoons canola oil
1 tablespoon water
¼ teaspoon vanilla extract

Cook's Notes:
For a healthier version, use 1 1/2 tablespoons of plain unsweetened applesauce and use 3 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon water instead of the milk.
